About the VML Tools
</h1>
<p class="author">
Author: Emil Brink, PDC, KTH 2006. For <a href="http://www.uni-verse.org/">Uni-Verse</a>.
</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
This text briefly describes the "saver" and "loader" Verse clients.
The purpose of these programs is to create and use disk files holding
Verse content, in textual format. This format, called VML ("Verse
Modelling Language"), is based on XML.
</p>
<p>
The tools were written in parallel by two authors; the saver by Eskil
Steenberg and the loader by Emil Brink. They are collected here since
they are functionally very related, and one is not very useful without
the other.
</p>

<h1>Licensing</h1>
<p>
Licensing for these applications is like this: the loader code, since
it depends on the GPL code from Purple, must be GPL too. The saver,
which uses only the Enough and Verse libraries (both BSD) is BSD. The
license texts are in COPYING.loader
</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>
This section talks about the dependencies for the two tools. It is <strong>only</strong> of
interest to people who want to compile the tools from scratch. If you have pre-compiled
("binary") versions of the tools already at hand, feel free to ignore this whole section.
</p>
<p>
Technically, the tools are widely different, owing to their different authors but also to
the different functionality.
</p>
<p>
Both tools naturally depend on Verse at the core; to build either, you
will need to have the header ("verse.h") and library ("libverse.a" on
Linux systems) in a location indicated by the VERSE variable in the Makefile.
</p>

<h2>Saver Dependencies</h2>
<p>
The saver depends on the "Enough" Verse data storage library, which is
also by Eskil. It is available in the "quelsolaar" CVS module, please
look it up if you do not already have it. The Makefile will need to
be edited to point to a location for the required header and library
files.
</p>
<h2>Loader Dependencies</h2>
<p>
The loader, on the other hand, depends on the general-purpose utility
code developed for the <a href="http://purple.blender.org/">Purple</a> scripting
environment. This is another Verse project, and is in the "purple"
<a href="http://projects.blender.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/purple/?cvsroot=verse">CVS module</a>.
Purple is here simply used as a source of fairly well-tested, basic utility code, to get up
and running the actual client as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
The following files are part of the Purple codebase (the extension ".[ch]" means that there
is both an implementation and a header file with the indicated base name):
<dl>
<dt><code>dynstr.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Dynamic (growable) strings.</dd>
<dt><code>list.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Doubly linked list.</dd>
<dt><code>log.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Basic error/warning logging.</dd>
<dt><code>mem.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Memory allocation.</dd>
<dt><code>memchunk.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Chunked memory allocation.</dd>
<dt><code>strutil.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Various string utility functions.</dd>
<dt><code>xmlnode.[ch]</code></dt>	<dd>Simple XML parser.</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
If possible in your environment, it might be a good idea to check out
the entire Purple module in a separate directory, and replace the above
files with symbolic links into Purple. That way, you will only have one
version of each of the shared files, and any updates (which are likely
to happen to the Purple side first, perhaps exclusively) will not be
missed. You can do this by editing the Makefile variable PURPLE to point
at your local copy of the Purple code, and then doing "make purplelink"
to replace the files with symbolic links to Purple.
</p>
<p>
Building the loader is easy, as illustrated by the included Makefile.
</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
Once you have the tools built, using them is simple.
</p>

<h2>Using the Saver</h2>
<p>
The saver is typically called from a command line, like this:
</p>
<pre class="shell">~> ./saver -1 -i 30 -f test.vml
</pre>
<p>
This will save the file only once and then exit (the "-1 option"), after
first waiting 30 seconds for data to download (the "-i 30"). The file will
be named <tt>test.vml</tt>, as indicated by the "-f test.vml" option. There are
other options, give it a "-h" option to display them.
</p>

<h2>Using the Loader</h2>
<p>
To upload the file <tt>test.vml</tt>, created by the saver above, one would issue a
command like this:
<pre class="shell">~> ./loader -ip=verse.example.org:4711 test.vml
</pre>
The <tt>-ip=</tt> option is used to set the IP address of the target Verse server. The port
number is optional, if omitted the default Verse port is used. All other arguments are assumed
to be filenames of VML files, which will be uploaded individually.
